		<h3>Question: What changes in gender ratio can be observed throughout different age groups from 1900 to 2000?</h3>
		<section>
			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

		<figcaption>
					Line Plot of Gender Ratios for Each Age Group in 1900 vs. 2000.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Clarity in Trends: Line plots are excellent for showing changes and trends over a continuous variable, in this case, age. The line plot clearly illustrates how the gender ratio changes with age in both years.</li>
				<li>Comparative Analysis: Using lines with distinct markers and styles for the two different years makes it easy to compare the gender ratios side by side across the same age groups.</li>
				<li>Visual Simplicity: The line plot provides a simple yet effective visual representation without overwhelming the viewer with too much data at once, allowing the audience to focus on the overall trend rather than individual data points.</li>
				<li>What didn't work: The plot may not clearly indicate the magnitude of population in each age group, meaning it shows the ratio but not how many people that ratio represents. Also, if the gender ratios are very similar, the lines could overlap, making it difficult to discern subtle differences.</li>
			</ul>

					Bar Chart Comparison for 1900 and 2000.

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Distinct Comparisons: Bar charts are intuitive for comparing quantities. The side-by-side placement of bars for the years 1900 and 2000 allows for direct visual comparison of gender ratios across each age group.</li>
				<li>Quantitative Emphasis: The height of each bar corresponds to the gender ratio, providing a clear visual cue of the magnitude of the ratio in each age group.</li>
				<li>Categorical Clarity: By grouping bars by age and having separate sets for each year, this chart distinctly categorizes the data, making it straightforward to interpret differences between the two years for each age group.</li>
				<li>What didn't work: The bars represent ratios without providing context for the absolute numbers involved. Large differences in population size between age groups are not represented, which could be misleading. Additionally, the bar chart can become cluttered, especially with many age groups.</li>
			</ul>

		<figcaption>
					Stacked Area Chart of Gender Ratios by Age Group.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Cumulative Representation: The stacked area chart was chosen to show how the proportions of gender ratios accumulate over age groups. This can visually represent the 'weight' of gender disparity as age increases.</li>
				<li>Visual Impact: Area charts have a strong visual impact, showing not only the trend but also the volume, which can make it easier for viewers to understand the significance of the data.</li>
				<li>Comparison of Distributions: While not successfully rendered due to technical issues, the rationale was to compare the distributions of gender ratios over age and show how the 'profile' of the population has changed from one century to another.</li>
				<li>What didn't work: The stacked area chart was intended to show the cumulative differences in gender ratios over all age groups. However, without being able to view the chart, it's challenging to assess how well it would have answered the research question. A potential limitation could be that while the chart would show the overall trend and the aggregate disparity between genders, it might not provide clear insights into specific age groups where significant changes in the gender ratio occurred. It could also obscure the details where the gender ratio changes are less pronounced, as the area covered by each gender ratio could blend together, making it hard to distinguish the contributions of individual age groups to the overall trend.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        
The first visualization, a line plot, offers a clear and straightforward comparison of gender ratios across age groups for the two years. Its strength lies in its simplicity and ease of tracing trends over time, making it particularly effective for identifying shifts in demographics. However, it may not effectively communicate the magnitude of the population due to the focus on ratios rather than raw numbers. The second visualization, a bar chart, provides a direct visual comparison between the two years for each age group, making disparities immediately apparent. It excels in showing the actual differences in gender ratio side by side, but can become cluttered, especially with many age categories. The presumed third visualization, a stacked area chart, would showcase cumulative trends and provide a sense of the overall distribution of gender ratios within the population over age groups. Its strength would be in illustrating the proportional representation and changes within the population layers, but it may obscure specific year-to-year comparisons due to the cumulative nature of the data presentation.

For the next phase, synthesizing elements from each sketch could involve overlaying the clear trend lines of the first visualization onto the stacked area chart to combine trend visibility with proportionate distribution. Alternatively, a dual-axis plot could be used to show both the gender ratio and the actual population numbers, addressing the weakness of the line plot. If one visualization had to be chosen as superior, it might be the line plot for its clarity and effectiveness in showing trends, which is often the primary objective in demographic analysis.
